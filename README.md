I have shown the percentage of positive, negative and neutral tweets by using smile and bar graph.

Pandas - It used for working with data sets.It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.
Seaborn - Seaborn is a library that uses Matplotlib underneath to plot graphs. It will be used to visualize random distribution.It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
Matplotlib - Matplotlib is a cross-platform, data visualization and graphical plotting library for Python and its numerical extension NumPy.It is a cross-platform library for making 2D plots from data in arrays.
Textblob - TextBlob for processing textual data. It provides a simple API for diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more.
